    Take a measurement with the tomograph from direction r_theta.


    Arguments:
    n_grid: number of cells of grid in each direction
    n_rays: number of parallel rays
    r_theta: direction of rays (in radians)

    Return:
    intensities: measured intensities for all <n_rays> rays of the measurement. intensities[n] contains the intensity for the n-th ray
    ray_indices: indices of rays that intersect a cell
    isect_indices: indices of intersected cells
    lengths: lengths of segments in intersected cells

    The tuple (ray_indices[n], isect_indices[n], lengths[n]) stores which ray has intersected which cell with which length. n runs from 0 to the amount of ray/cell intersections (-1) of this measurement.

    Raised Exceptions:
    -
